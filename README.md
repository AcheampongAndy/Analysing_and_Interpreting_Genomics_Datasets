# Analysing and Interpreting Genomics Datasets

## Course Overview
This course provides a practical introduction to the analysis and interpretation of genomics datasets. It covers key concepts in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and its significance in genomics research. You will gain hands-on experience with widely-used bioinformatics tools and file formats, as well as essential Linux commands for sequence quality control, mapping, and variant calling.

Additionally, you will learn how to perform bioinformatics analysis using the workflow management system **Nextflow**, specifically as applied to **viralrecon**, an existing bioinformatics pipeline. The course also includes **data visualization techniques in RStudio** for analyzing variants obtained from genomic data.
