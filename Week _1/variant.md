## **What is Variant Calling?**
Variant calling is the process of identifying genetic differences between a given DNA sequence and a reference genome. These differences, called **variants**, can range from single base changes to large structural changes in the genome.

DNA sequencing technologies generate raw sequence data (usually in FASTQ format), which is then aligned to a reference genome (producing BAM/CRAM files). Variant calling is performed on these aligned sequences to detect and characterize mutations, leading to a variant call format (VCF) file containing the identified genetic variations.

## **Types of Variants**
There are several types of genetic variants, each representing a different kind of alteration in the DNA sequence:

### **1. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**
- The most common type of genetic variation.
- Involves a single base substitution at a specific position in the DNA.
- Example: A **C** in the reference genome might be replaced with a **T** in a sample.

### **2. Insertions (Ins)**
- Occurs when one or more nucleotides are **added** to the DNA sequence.
- Example: Reference genome: `AGTCG` → Variant sequence: `AGTTTCG`

### **3. Deletions (Del)**
- Occurs when one or more nucleotides are **removed** from the DNA sequence.
- Example: Reference genome: `AGTCG` → Variant sequence: `AGG`

### **4. Indels**
- A combination of **insertions** and **deletions**.
- Example: Reference genome: `AGTCG` → Variant sequence: `AGTTG`

### **5. Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**
- Large segments of DNA (from hundreds to millions of base pairs) that are either **duplicated or deleted**.
- Example: Some individuals may have **extra copies** of a gene, while others may be missing it.

### **6. Translocations**
- A segment of DNA moves from **one location to another**, either within the same chromosome or between different chromosomes.
- This can disrupt genes and cause diseases such as cancer.

### **7. Inversions**
- A segment of DNA is **flipped** in orientation.
- Example: `AGTCG` in the reference genome might appear as `GCTGA` in a variant.

Understanding these variant types is crucial for identifying disease-causing mutations, studying evolution, and conducting population genetics research.

## **Factors Affecting Variant Calling**
Not all detected variants are **real**. Many are false positives due to errors in sequencing and data processing. Several factors can introduce errors:

### **1. Contamination**
- DNA samples can get contaminated during extraction and sequencing.
- This leads to mixed signals and incorrect variant calls.

### **2. PCR and Sequencing Errors**
- PCR amplification can introduce errors by misincorporating nucleotides.
- Sequencing technologies have different error rates (e.g., Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore have unique biases).

### **3. Homopolymer Runs**
- Sequences with long stretches of the same nucleotide (e.g., `AAAAAAA`) can confuse sequencers, leading to errors.

### **4. Repetitive Sequences**
- Variants in highly repetitive regions (such as tandem repeats or transposons) are difficult to map accurately.

### **5. Alignment Errors**
- Short reads (e.g., 100-150 bases) may not map uniquely to the genome, leading to misalignment.
- Misalignment can introduce false SNPs and indels.

### **6. False SNP Calls Near Indels**
- Variant callers may incorrectly detect SNPs around insertion/deletion events due to local alignment artifacts.

### **Solution: Filtering and Quality Control**
To ensure accurate variant calls, bioinformaticians apply strict **quality control (QC) filters** based on:
- **Read depth:** Ensuring enough supporting reads are present.
- **Base quality scores:** Removing low-confidence base calls.
- **Mapping quality:** Ensuring sequences are mapped uniquely.
- **Allele frequency filters:** Removing rare sequencing artifacts.

## **Tools for Variant Calling**
Several software tools are used to detect variants from sequencing data:

### **1. GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)**
- Developed by the Broad Institute.
- Uses sophisticated algorithms for SNP and Indel calling.
- Supports local realignment around indels and base quality score recalibration.

### **2. Samtools**
- Provides a basic variant caller (`bcftools`).
- Works efficiently with BAM/CRAM files for SNP and small indel calling.

### **3. FreeBayes**
- A haplotype-based Bayesian variant caller.
- Detects SNPs, indels, and complex variants.

## **Variant Call Format (VCF)**
The **VCF file** is a standard output format for variant calling. It is a tab-delimited text file containing information about each variant. 

### **Key Fields in a VCF File**
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| CHROM | Chromosome name |
| POS | Position of the variant |
| ID | Unique variant identifier |
| REF | Reference allele |
| ALT | Alternate allele(s) |
| QUAL | Confidence score of the variant call |
| FILTER | Quality filters applied |
| INFO | Additional information (e.g., allele frequency, functional annotation) |
| FORMAT | Specifies per-sample fields like genotype quality (GQ) and allele depth (AD) |
| SAMPLE | Genotype data for each individual |

## **Future of Variant Calling**
Traditional variant calling relies on **linear reference genomes and short-read sequencing**. However, new **de novo assembly** and **graph-based methods** are improving accuracy.

### **1. Local de novo Assembly**
- Instead of aligning reads one at a time, these methods **assemble local regions of the genome** to improve variant detection.
- Can detect SNPs, indels, and **complex structural variations** simultaneously.
- Example tools: **GATK HaplotypeCaller, Scalpel, Octopus.**

### **2. Variation Graph-Based Variant Calling**
- Uses a **graph-based genome representation** instead of a single reference sequence.
- Represents **multiple haplotypes and structural variants** more accurately.
- Improves **variant calling in highly variable regions** like the HLA genes.
- Example tools: **vg (Variation Graph toolkit).**

These approaches will enhance our ability to study **rare mutations, structural variations, and ancestry-based genetic differences.**
