# Glossary of Terms

## 0-Based Indexing  
A system of numbering where the count starts from 0, used in file formats like BED.

## 1-Based Indexing  
A system of numbering where the count starts from 1, used in file formats like GTF/GFF, SAM/BAM, and WIG.

## Adapters  
Short DNA sequences used to attach DNA fragments to the flow cell and facilitate sequencing.

## Assembly  
The process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and putting them back together to create a representation of the original chromosomes from short or long sequencing read data.

## AWS  
Amazon Web Services.

## Azure  
Microsoft Azure.

## Base  
A nucleotide building block of DNA, represented by adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G).

## Basecall File Format (bas.h5/bax.h5)  
A file format generated by PacBio sequencing platforms, containing base call information that can be visualized using HDFView.

## Binary Base Call (BCL) Format  
Raw data files produced by Illumina sequencing platforms (e.g., NextSeq, HiSeq, NovaSeq 6000), which can be converted to FASTQ format using the bcl2fastq Conversion tool.

## Bridge PCR  
A principle of DNA sequencing involving the use of bridge PCR to amplify and immobilize DNA templates for sequencing.

## Checkpointing  
The process of periodically saving (or writing) the execution state of an application.

## Cluster  
A localized group of DNA fragments generated through bridge PCR amplification from a single template DNA strand on a flow cell during sequencing.

## Coverage  
The number of times a specific DNA sequence has been read in a sequencing experiment.

## CPU  
Central processing unit.

## Data Frame  
A common data structure that organizes data in columns and rows. For NGS data, this two-dimensional file usually stores experiment variables in columns and their individual entries in rows.

## De Novo Sequencing  
Sequencing method used to assemble a genome without a reference genome.

## Dependency  
A software dependency is a relationship between software components where one component relies on the other to work properly.

## DNA Sequencing  
The process of reading the nucleotides present in DNA to determine the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule.

## Docker and Singularity  
Containerization tools that package up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Enrichment-Based Library Preparation  
The library preparation step used to prepare samples for sequencing, ensuring enrichment through targeted amplification of genomic regions of interest.

## FASTQ File  
A text-based format used to store raw sequence data from NGS platforms.

## FASTQ ORA Format  
A binary and compressed version of the standard FASTQ file used for efficient data storage and management on Illumina platforms.

## FastQC  
A tool for quality control checks on FASTQ sequence data.

## File Formats  
Various text-based (FASTQ, FASTA, SAM, BED, GTF/GFF, VCF, WIG) and binary (BAM, BCF, SFF) formats used to store DNA sequencing data.

## Genomics  
The study of an organismâ€™s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes.

## Illumina Sequencing  
A well-known NGS platform that produces short reads using reversible dye-terminators.

## Nanopore Sequencing  
A sequencing method where DNA passes through a nanopore, generating electrical signals corresponding to individual bases.

## Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)  
A set of advanced sequencing techniques that enable the rapid analysis of DNA and RNA sequences.

## Operators in R  
- `<- or =` Assignment operators for variables.
- `?` Help operator.
- `" "` Quotation marks specifying patterns.
- `$` Extracts specific data from a data frame.
- `#` Comment operator.
- `+` Used for multiline scripts.
- `%>%` Pipe operator in `dplyr`.
- `%in%` Filters specific values.
- `==` Comparison operator.
- `>=` Greater than or equal comparison.
- `&` Logical AND operator.
- `|` Logical OR operator.

## Variant Calling  
The process of identifying genetic variations like SNPs and indels in DNA or RNA sequences.

## Variant Calling Format (VCF)  
A file format storing variant information, including read depth and genotype.

## Version Control  
The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
